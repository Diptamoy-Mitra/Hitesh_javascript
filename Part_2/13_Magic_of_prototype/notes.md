## prototypes 

## Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.



## Array ---> Object ---> NULL(No parent of object)
## string ---> Object ---> NULL (same)
